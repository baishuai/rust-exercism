Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency. Rust does not use a garbage collector, but instead ensures safety and optimizes code at compile time. The concept of ownership is how Rust achieves its largest goal, memory safety.
Rust core and the standard library contain a minimal set of functionality. Rustaceans are encouraged to add features, in the form of libraries called crates, to the language and then share them on crates.io.
As a systems-level language, Rust is frequently used for building any tool where speed, performance and stability are paramount. The Awesome Rust list collects examples of Rust projects, which include CLI tools, ORMs, operating systems and games. Regardless of what you build in Rust, it will be fast and memory safe!
The home page for Rust is rust-lang.org. Rust has excellent documentation at rust-lang.org/documentation.html. Newcomers should start with "The Book" located at doc.rust-lang.org/book/.

Try It!

If you've downloaded the command-line client and have Rust installed on your machine, then go ahead and fetch the first problem.


`exercism fetch rust`

In order to be able to submit your solution, you'll need to configure the client with your Exercism API key.


`exercism configure --key=YOUR_EXERCISM_KEY`

When you've written a solution, submit it to the site. You'll have to configure the command-line client with your exercism API key before you can submit.


`exercism submit PATH_TO_FILE`
